## Lesson 1: Selenium Features, what you need to know

## Overview
Covers some of the basics of what Selenium is, what it does, and why it is relevant today.

## Key Concepts
- Open source, that makes it free to everyone
- Exclusively for web based applications, if it can render on the web, you can test it
- Supports multiple browsers ie. Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera, but Opera isnt used commonly
- Supports multiple operating systems including windows, mac, and linux
- Can be coded in multiple languages, Java, C#, Python, JS, php, and Ruby
- Java is what is most commonly used for Selenium
- Selenium refers to the set of tools that currently consists of WebDriver and IDE, we will be focusing on WebDriver
- WebDriver helps create test, and IDE is used for bug recreation and recording interactions to play them back
- WebDriver used to be called Remote Control, but that version was deprecated about 15 years ago

## Lesson 2: Selenium WebDriver Architecture Simplified

## Overview
Discusses some of the back end operations Selenium WebDriver uses when you write a script.

## Key Concepts
- Selenium client libraries for each language (ie. the Java Library) can be translated into HTTP requests that follow
the W3C WebDriver protocol.
- W3C is a protocol that most browsers understand, so this is ideal since chrome, safari, etc can all use it without
needing to worry about translating to something else. This ensures consistent behavior.
- Each browser has its own dedicated driver. The driver is a small program that acts as a translator between the
WebDriver protocol and the browser itself.
- Browser takes the W3C request and converts it into the native language that the browser can understand, 
this helps control the actual web browser by carrying out actions the script defines (ie, clicking a button).
